Textual Analysis of 1500 recent academic papers in computer systems using Natural Language Processing

Currently working on this as my capstone project - Doing a textual analysis of close to 1500 recent academic papers in the field of computer systems from top conferences using natural language processing. Performing the following to extract meaningful relationships and statistics about their content:
● Text Normalization: tokening, lemmatizing, stemming, parts of speech tagging, removing stopwords, etc
● Text Classification: feature extraction (tf-idf & bag of words), classification algorithms (Multinomial Naive Bayes & SVM)
● Text Summarization: topic modelling (LDA), word2vec
● Text Similarity: cosine similarity

Trying to answer the following overarching question:
Can we use the current information to predict the relevant topics in computer systems in the near future?

This is a work in progress
